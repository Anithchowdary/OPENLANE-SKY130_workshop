## WORKSHOP DAY 1
  Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
### 1.Architecture of a chip
   chip is centered in the package.package and chip are connected by wires so that they can send the signals in and out.the packages has PADS:these pads are used to send signals in and out of the chip.the size of the package is given the size of the die.A core consists of foundary IP's and macros
   
  * MACROS(all the digital blocks are called macros)  eg:Socs,SP1
  * FOUNDARY IP's(they are manufactured in the foundary,it is a place where manufacturing is done)  eg: PLL,adc0,ac1,dac,SRAM
